# Face Recognition using Deep Learning CNN
Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) changed the way we used to learn images. It made it very very easy! CNN mimics the way humans see images, by focussing on one portion of the image at a time and scanning the whole image.

CNN boils down every image as a vector of numbers, which can be learned by the fully connected Dense layers of ANN. More information about CNN can be found here.

Below diagram summarises the overall flow of CNN algorithm.
